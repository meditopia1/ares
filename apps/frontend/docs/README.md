6. Finance
7. Claims
8. Provider
9. Call Centre
10. Authorization
11. Member
12. Onboarding

## Folder Structure

### `project/`

Project-level references, system setup, dashboard roles, plans, member filters, import templates, and current provider workstate.

### `data/`

Source data files such as member and provider spreadsheets/CSVs.

### `claims/`

Claims forms, GOP/pre-authorization templates, tariffs, workflows, and hospital claims workspace documentation.

### `netcash/`

Netcash debit order, transaction, refund, webhook, and reconciliation documentation.

### `benefits/`

Benefit limits, waiting periods, exclusions, and benefit configuration references.

### `compliance/`

Compliance, CMS, PMB, and Medical Schemes Act documentation.

### `operations/`

Operational training, SLAs, provider contracts, and process documents.

### `guides/`

Current setup notes, operational guides, and narrow implementation references. Old status reports, completion notes, and stale copy-paste SQL snippets should not live here.

### `internal-review/`

Security/OCR review notes that are still useful. Historical implementation-complete notes should be removed once superseded by current project docs.

### `cover plan brochures/`

Plan brochures and public-facing product PDFs.

### `private/`

Local/private notes that should not be treated as public product documentation.

## Documentation Rules

1. Keep all project documentation under this folder.
2. Do not create a second root `docs/` folder.
3. Use dashboard-role terminology from `project/CURRENT_DASHBOARD_ROLES.md`.
4. Put provider-specific payment docs in their own folder. Netcash remains under `netcash/`.
5. Keep claims and GOP material under `claims/`.
