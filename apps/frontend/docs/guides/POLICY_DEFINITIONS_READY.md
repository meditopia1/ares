## What's Been Completed

### 1. Database Table ✅
- `policy_definitions` table created in Supabase
- Includes all necessary fields: id, product_id, term, definition, category, display_order
- Indexes created for performance
- RLS policies enabled for security
- **Currently has 5 sample definitions**

### 2. Backend API ✅
All endpoints are live and functional:
- `GET /api/v1/products/:id/definitions` - Get all definitions for a product
- `POST /api/v1/products/:id/definitions` - Add new definition
- `PUT /api/v1/products/definitions/:definitionId` - Update definition
- `DELETE /api/v1/products/definitions/:definitionId` - Delete definition

### 3. Frontend Page ✅
Location: `/admin/products/[id]/benefits`

Features:
- View all definitions for a product
- Add new definitions with term, category, and definition text
- Edit existing definitions inline
- Delete definitions with confirmation
- Categories: General, Medical, Legal, Financial
- Clean, user-friendly interface

You mentioned you want to provide the full policy document text with all 9 sections:

3. General Provisions
4. Payment of Premium
5. General Exclusions and Limitations
6. General Conditions
