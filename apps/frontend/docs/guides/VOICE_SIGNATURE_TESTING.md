## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Voice Recording Issues:

**Problem:** Microphone permission denied
- **Solution:** Check browser settings → Site permissions → Microphone

**Problem:** "Uploading..." never completes
- **Solution:** Check browser console for errors
- Verify storage policies are active
- Run: `node test-storage-upload.js`

**Problem:** Voice shows 0:00 / 0:00 in admin
- **Solution:** This means blob URL was saved instead of storage URL
- Check browser console during recording
- Verify upload completed before submission

### Signature Issues:

**Problem:** "Uploading..." never completes
- **Solution:** Check browser console for errors
- Verify storage policies are active
- Run: `node test-storage-upload.js`

**Problem:** Signature not displaying in admin

- Should be storage URL (starts with `https://<current-supabase-url>`)

### General Issues:

**Problem:** Upload fails with 403 error
- **Solution:** Storage policies not set up correctly
- Go to Supabase Dashboard → Storage → applications → Policies
- Verify 4 policies exist for public role

**Problem:** Upload fails with 415 error
- **Solution:** MIME type not allowed
- Run: `node update-storage-bucket.js`
