```

## Current Process Notes

- Netcash is the active payment collection path.
- Qsure material has been removed from active documentation.
- Current infrastructure direction is documented in [CURRENT_INFRASTRUCTURE.md](./CURRENT_INFRASTRUCTURE.md).
- The feedback feature has been removed from runtime navigation and API routes.
- Hospital claims are handled through the hospital claims workspace and related GOP intake flow.
- Africa Assist can submit GOP documents through the Authorization dashboard, which feeds the Claims hospital workspace notification flow.

## Rules

1. Keep all project docs under `apps/frontend/docs`.
2. Do not recreate a root `docs/` folder.
3. Keep claims and GOP material under `apps/frontend/docs/claims`.
4. Keep Netcash material under `apps/frontend/docs/netcash`.
5. Treat older external planning/status files as historical unless migrated into this docs tree.
