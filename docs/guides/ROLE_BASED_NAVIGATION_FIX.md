# Role-Based Navigation Fix

## Problem
Every user account showed the same sidebar navigation regardless of their role. An admin, member, broker, and claims assessor all saw identical menu items.

## Solution
Implemented role-based navigation that dynamically changes the sidebar menu based on the logged-in user's role.

## Navigation by Role

### 1. System Admin (`system_admin`)
**Sidebar Menu:**
- Admin Dashboard → `/admin/dashboard`
- Members → `/admin/members`
- Policies → `/admin/policies`
- Products → `/admin/products`
- Claims → `/admin/claims`
- Providers → `/admin/providers`
- Finance → `/admin/finance`
- Brokers → `/admin/brokers`

**Purpose:** Full system administration and oversight

---

### 2. Member (`member`)
**Sidebar Menu:**
- Dashboard → `/dashboard`
- My Policies → `/policies`
- My Claims → `/claims`
- Payments → `/payments`
- Documents → `/documents`
- Profile → `/profile`

**Purpose:** Personal account management for scheme members

---

### 3. Broker (`broker`)
**Sidebar Menu:**
- Dashboard → `/broker/dashboard`
- My Clients → `/broker/clients`
- Policies → `/broker/policies`
- Commissions → `/broker/commissions`
- Profile → `/profile`

**Purpose:** Manage clients and track commissions

---

### 4. Claims Assessor (`claims_assessor`)
**Sidebar Menu:**
- Dashboard → `/claims-assessor/dashboard`
- Claims Queue → `/claims-assessor/queue`
- My Claims → `/claims-assessor/my-claims`
- Profile → `/profile`

**Purpose:** Review and adjudicate claims

---

### 5. Finance Manager (`finance_manager`)
**Sidebar Menu:**
- Dashboard → `/finance/dashboard`
- Payments → `/finance/payments`
- Reconciliations → `/finance/reconciliations`
- Reports → `/finance/reports`
- Profile → `/profile`

**Purpose:** Financial management and reporting

---

### 6. Compliance Officer (`compliance_officer`)
**Sidebar Menu:**
- Dashboard → `/dashboard` (default member view for now)
- My Policies → `/policies`
- My Claims → `/claims`
- Payments → `/payments`
- Documents → `/documents`
- Profile → `/profile`

**Purpose:** Compliance monitoring (uses default member navigation)

---

### 7. Authorization Users (`ambulance_operator`, `africa_assist_authorization`)
**Public Login Tile:**
- Authorizations

**Shared Routes:**
- Dashboard → `/authorizations/dashboard`
- Unified verification / benefit check → `/authorizations/member-verification`
- Verification History → `/authorizations/history`

**Ambulance Operator Sidebar:**
- Dashboard → `/authorizations/dashboard`
- Ambulance Benefit Check → `/authorizations/member-verification`
- Verification History → `/authorizations/history`

**Africa Assist Authorization Sidebar:**
- Dashboard → `/authorizations/dashboard`
- Hospital Benefit Check → `/authorizations/member-verification`
- GOP Intake → `/authorizations/gop-intake`
- Verification History → `/authorizations/history`

**Purpose:** External authorization users verify member/policy status and confirm the relevant benefit before transport, hospital pre-auth, or GOP intake proceeds. These dashboards must expose only the minimum information needed for verification.

---

## How It Works

The `SidebarLayout` component now includes a `getNavigationForRole()` function that:

1. Checks the user's roles from `user?.roles` array
2. Determines which role takes precedence
3. Returns the appropriate navigation items for that role
4. Dynamically renders the sidebar menu

## Testing

### Test Each Role:

**1. Admin:**
```
Email: admin@day1main.com
Password: admin123
Expected: See "Admin Dashboard", "Members", "Policies", etc.
```

**2. Member:**
```
Email: member@day1main.com
Password: member123
Expected: See "Dashboard", "My Policies", "My Claims", etc.
```

**3. Broker:**
```
Email: broker@day1main.com
Password: broker123
Expected: See "Dashboard", "My Clients", "Commissions", etc.
```

**4. Claims Assessor:**
```
Email: assessor@day1main.com
Password: assessor123
Expected: See "Dashboard", "Claims Queue", "My Claims"
```

**5. Finance Manager:**
```
Email: finance@day1main.com
Password: finance123
Expected: See "Dashboard", "Payments", "Reconciliations", "Reports"
```

**6. Compliance Officer:**
```
Email: compliance@day1main.com
Password: compliance123
Expected: See default member navigation
```

**7. Ambulance Authorization Demo:**
```
Email: ambu@out.com
Password: ambu123
Expected: See Authorization Dashboard, Ambulance Benefit Check, Verification History
```

**8. Africa Assist Authorization Demo:**
```
Email: afri@out.com
Password: afri123
Expected: See Authorization Dashboard, Hospital Benefit Check, GOP Intake, Verification History
```

## Files Modified

- `apps/frontend/src/components/layout/sidebar-layout.tsx`
  - Added `getNavigationForRole()` function
  - Replaced hardcoded navigation array with dynamic role-based navigation
  - Added role detection logic

## Expected Behavior

✅ **Different users see different menus** based on their role
✅ **Admin sees admin-specific pages** (Members, Products, Providers, etc.)
✅ **Members see member-specific pages** (My Policies, My Claims, etc.)
✅ **Brokers see broker-specific pages** (My Clients, Commissions, etc.)
✅ **Each role has appropriate access** to their functional areas
✅ **User info still displays correctly** (name, email, avatar initials)

## Next Steps

After clearing browser cache and logging in with different accounts, you should now see:
- Different sidebar menus for each role
- Role-appropriate navigation items
- Correct user information (name, email, avatar)

The navigation is now properly personalized for each user type!
